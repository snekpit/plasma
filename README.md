Qt and KDE recipes for the Serpent OS collection, including the Plasma desktop.

## Packaging Recommendations

The KDE project has [guidelines](https://community.kde.org/Distributions/Packaging_Recommendations) on how KDE packages should ship. While we're free, as a distribution, to add customizations on top of them, it's desiderable to adhere to the guidelines as much as possible for a valuable experience out-of-the-box.

Individual software releases are available under the terms specified

a software package is under the relevant license for each upstream.
